# Sandwich Game
 
sorry if this is bad, it's a prototype and i cant make a github pages site w/ a private repository without paying :/

sandwich game - simplest prototype

1: sandwich selling

	press button -> make sandwich
	
	sandwich over time gets sold based on tastiness
	
2: sandwich making

	make sandwich using ingredients and save recipe, name sandiches and save them in a recipe book
	
	sandwiches have stats, such as cost to make & sell price, tastiness, and bonus stats
	
	Sandwiches can be made of anything, but the top and bottom must be the same ingredient
	
3: ingredient searching

	Explore the environment for ingredients, plus some bonus stuff like money or finding shops to buy ingredients directly
